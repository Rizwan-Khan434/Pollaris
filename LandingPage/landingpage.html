<!DOCTYPE html><!-- Every HTML page must have this at the top -->
<html><!-- everything must be inside of the <html></html> tags. Almost every tag that you put must also be closed (<html> opens, </html> closes) -->
<head> <!-- the head is where you put things unrelated to what shows up on the main page, such as the title that appears in the tab, or linking your css
and javascript files (you can also directly but css and javascript code here too, but linking external files is neater -->
<title> Pollaris - Choose Your Role </title> <!-- the name that appears on the tab in the browser -->

<link rel="stylesheet" href="landingpage.css"> <!-- links the css page --> <!-- for this page i won't be relying on css too much since there aren't that many items -->
</head>

<body> <!-- the body is where almost everything that appears on the page goes. you can also put some default style-related stuff in the tag that will effect everything
inside the body as default (for example, setting the font to 20 in the body tag makes the default text size 20 automatically), although this can be redundant if you're 
using css -->

<img src = "pollaris logo.png" class = "center"> <!-- a class is like a marker you can put. in css, you can set settings related to a class and it'll effect all items with that class name -->

<p>Choose Your Role: </p> <!-- a paragraph. pretty much just put it around text whenever you want to style it -->
<!-- there's more than one unit you can scale font size by, but usually "rem" is the best thing to use since it'll automatically scale with the size of the browser -->

<br> <!-- this adds a vertical space in the page. like the equivalent of hitting enter when you're typing -->

<button onclick = "window.location.href = '../Authentication/Instructor/signup.html';"> Instructor</button> 
<!-- clicking will send you to the link -->
<button onclick = "window.location.href = '../Authentication/Student/join.html';"> Student </button>
<!-- you can put a link to a real website too. but if you're using other html pages you have to type the full address for the file. for example, if
test1 and test2 were in a folder called "thisfolder", you would need to put "thisfolder\" before them -->
